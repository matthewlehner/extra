<h2 class="header-quote">
  Social media is only a small part of what I do, and it‚Äôs constantly pulling me
  away from higher-value tasks.
</h2>

<p>
  SOUND FAMILIAR? ‚Äì It's something we hear from marketers a lot. Social media
  management takes a lot of time. It's easy to feel like you're only treading
  water.
</p>

<h4>It's also hard to optimize:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    You spend hours every week trawling for new content to post. At least some
    of these hours could have been better spent on tasks with a higher ROI.
  </li>
  <li>
    You've produced a lot of posts and podcasts over teh past few years, but
    they don't seem to drive much traffic. You wonder if it's because nobody saw
    them, or because you did something wrong.
  </li>
  <li>
    You've tried being in constant social media contact, but it seems to require
    more work than it's worth. You see larger brands doing it, but think they
    must have staff, or a secret workflow to make it easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    You worry about investing too much time into a particular piece of content
    because you're afraid nobody is going to see it. But the only way to be
    effective with content marketing is to produce high-quality content.
  </li>
  <li>
    You're finding content increasingly expensive to produce (video, in
    particular, seems way outside your budget) and now it seems that you have to
    pay for distribution. You wonder if there's a viable way to distribute
    content across social networks for free anymore.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These are problems every digital marketer has to grapple with <em>in 2016.</em>
  But they aren't as difficult to solve as you might imagine.
</p>

<h4>What if:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    You didn't have to spend more than an hour or two every week adding new
    content to your social media accounts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your work could "stack" or compound, meaning an hour spent on social media
    this month would mean an hour saved next month.
  </li>
  <li>
    You had the perfect editorial calendar, generated based on actual customer
    engagement patterns.
  </li>
  <li>
    You could automatically post, according to that editorial calendar, at the
    perfect time of day, every day.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>That would mean:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    You could get off the hamster wheel of collecting, scheduling, posting, and
    reposting content.
  </li>
  <li>
    You could focus on producing your own, higher-value content (like video) or
    marketing tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    You'd be able to maintain a consistent presence across all platforms without
    having to hire a lacky.
  </li>
  <li>
    You'd be able to drive some traffic to your site without having to sponsor
    every single post.
  </li>
</ul>

    <p>But that's a complete fantasy, right?</p>
    <p>Nope! Not with <em>Extra</em>üçª.</p>
  </figure>

  <p>
    <strong>Extra</strong> is a social media automation tool that aims to limit
    the amount of time that you spend on social media to just one hour per week.
    It does this by reposting content strategically, maximizing impressions,
    while minimizing repeats.
  </p>

  <p>
    We'll analyze your customers' actual engagement patterns, building a killer
    editorial calendar from your existing posts, and posting for you at the
    perfect moment, each and every day.

  <h4>Does reposting content meaningfully increase traffic?</h4>

  <p>
    Reposting content has been shown to substantially increase engagement and
    impressions. Reposts degrade at an average rate of 30%. A post recycled by
    Extra twice is likely to receive <strong>double the impressions</strong> of
    what it would have received originally. That's enough to make or break your
    next social media campaign.
